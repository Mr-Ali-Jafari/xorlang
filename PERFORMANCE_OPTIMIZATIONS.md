# XorLang v2.0.0 Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in XorLang v2.0.0 to improve interpreter speed and efficiency.

## Overview

XorLang v2.0.0 includes several key performance optimizations that significantly improve execution speed while maintaining the same language semantics and functionality.

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Environment Variable Caching

**Problem**: Variable lookups in nested environments required traversing the scope chain on every access.

**Solution**: Implemented a caching mechanism in the `Environment` class that stores resolved variables with version tracking.

```python
class Environment:
    def __init__(self, parent: Optional['Environment'] = None):
        self.parent = parent
        self.values: Dict[str, Any] = {}
        # Performance optimization: Cache resolved variables
        self._cache: Dict[str, Tuple[Any, int]] = {}
        self._cache_version = 0
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces variable lookup time from O(depth) to O(1) for cached variables
- Automatic cache invalidation when variables are modified
- Significant speedup for frequently accessed variables

### 2. Method Dispatch Table

**Problem**: The `eval()` method used string-based method lookup and multiple if-statements for each node type.

**Solution**: Implemented a method dispatch table that caches method references by node type.

```python
# Performance optimization: Use method dispatch table
_eval_methods = {}

def eval(self, node: ASTNode, env: Optional[Environment] = None) -> Any:
    node_type = type(node)
    
    # Performance optimization: Use method dispatch table
    if node_type not in self._eval_methods:
        method_name = f'_eval_{node_type.__name__}'
        method = getattr(self, method_name, self._generic_eval)
        self._eval_methods[node_type] = method
    
    return self._eval_methods[node_type](node, env)
```

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates repeated string operations and method lookups
- Reduces branching in the main evaluation loop
- Faster method dispatch for all node types

### 3. Method Lookup Caching

**Problem**: Member access operations (object.method) required repeated lookups in class hierarchies.

**Solution**: Added caching for method lookups with object and member name as keys.

```python
def _eval_MemberAccessNode(self, node: MemberAccessNode, env: Environment) -> Any:
    # Performance optimization: Cache method lookups
    cache_key = (id(obj), member_name)
    if cache_key in self._method_cache:
        return self._method_cache[cache_key]
```

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates repeated method lookups for the same object/member combinations
- Faster method calls in loops and frequently accessed methods
- Reduced overhead for object-oriented code

### 4. Standard Library Caching

**Problem**: Standard library files were parsed and evaluated on every interpreter instantiation.

**Solution**: Implemented AST caching for standard library files.

```python
# Performance optimization: Pre-load stdlib to avoid repeated file I/O
self._stdlib_cache = {}

def _load_stdlib_file(self, filename):
    # Performance optimization: Check cache first
    if filename in self._stdlib_cache:
        return self._stdlib_cache[filename]
```

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates repeated file I/O operations
- Reduces parsing overhead for standard library modules
- Faster interpreter startup time

### 5. Built-in Function Optimization

**Problem**: Built-in functions were wrapped in tuples with metadata, adding overhead.

**Solution**: Direct function references for simple operations and optimized math function calls.

```python
# Math built-ins - Performance optimization: Use direct math module functions
math_builtins = {
    '__math_sin': math.sin,
    '__math_cos': math.cos,
    '__math_tan': math.tan,
    # ... more functions
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduced function call overhead for built-ins
- Direct access to Python's optimized math functions
- Faster mathematical operations

## Memory Optimizations

### 1. Reduced Object Creation

- Cached frequently used objects and values
- Reused method references where possible
- Minimized temporary object allocations

### 2. Efficient Data Structures

- Used `__slots__` for frequently created objects
- Optimized dictionary lookups
- Reduced memory footprint for core data types

## Future Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Bytecode Compilation

Consider implementing a bytecode compiler to further improve performance:

```python
# Potential future optimization
class BytecodeCompiler:
    def compile(self, ast: ASTNode) -> List[Instruction]:
        # Convert AST to bytecode instructions
        pass
```

### 2. JIT Compilation

For frequently executed code paths, consider just-in-time compilation:

```python
# Potential future optimization
class JITCompiler:
    def compile_hot_path(self, function: FunctionValue) -> Callable:
        # Compile hot functions to native code
        pass
```

### 3. Optimized String Operations

Implement string interning and more efficient string operations:

```python
# Potential future optimization
class StringInterner:
    def intern(self, string: str) -> str:
        # Return cached string instance
        pass
```

## Conclusion
